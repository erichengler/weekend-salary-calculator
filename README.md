# Weekend Salary Calculator

## Description

This app takes in 5 different input values; First Name, Last Name, ID Number, Job Title, and Salary. When the submit button is clicked, these values are sent from the inputs to a table below to be displayed, along with a delete button for each submission. Then the input fields are cleared. 

Total monthly cost is calculated by dividing each person's yearly salary by 12 and then adding them together. If the total monthly cost is over 20,000, its background will be red.

When the delete button is clicked, the submission is removed from the table and the total monthly cost is recalculated.
